# Question: How do you simulate a simplified banking system with deposit, withdraw, and transfer operations? C# Summary

The provided C# code simulates a simplified banking system by defining an `Account` class that represents a bank account with properties for `Id` and `Balance`, and methods for `Deposit`, `Withdraw`, and `Transfer` operations. Each account is initialized with an `Id` and an `initialBalance`. The `Deposit` method increases the account's balance by a specified amount, while the `Withdraw` method decreases the balance by a specified amount, provided the account has sufficient funds. If the account does not have enough funds for a withdrawal, a message is printed to the console. The `Transfer` method transfers a specified amount from one account to another, provided the source account has sufficient funds. If the source account does not have enough funds, a message is printed to the console. The `Main` method in the `Program` class demonstrates the creation of two accounts and the use of the `Deposit`, `Withdraw`, and `Transfer` methods, printing the balance of each account after each operation.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a similar object-oriented approach to the C# version, with a class `Account` that has methods for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring money. 

The main differences between the two versions are:

1. **Property Access:** In C#, properties `Id` and `Balance` are defined with `get` and `private set`, which means they can be read from outside the class but can only be modified within the class. In Python, there is no direct equivalent to this. All attributes are public by default, but by convention, a leading underscore is used to indicate that an attribute is intended to be private.

2. **Error Handling:** In the C# version, if a withdrawal or transfer is attempted that would result in a negative balance, the operation is not performed and a message is printed to the console. In the Python version, a similar check is performed, but instead of silently failing, a message is printed to the console.

3. **String Formatting:** The Python version uses f-strings (formatted string literals) to include variable values directly in the string. This is a feature not available in C#, which instead uses concatenation or `string.Format()` to achieve similar results.

4. **Main Function:** In Python, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct allows the file to be imported as a module without running the main function. This is not a feature in C#, where the `Main` method is the entry point of the program and is always run when the program starts.

5. **Type Declaration:** In C#, variables and parameters must have their types declared. Python is dynamically typed, so no type declarations are needed.

6. **Object Instantiation:** In C#, new objects are created with the `new` keyword. In Python, the `new` keyword is not used; instead, the class is called like a function to create a new instance.

# Java Differences

The Java and C# versions of the banking system are quite similar in their approach to solving the problem. Both versions define an `Account` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds. However, there are a few differences in the language features and methods used in each version.

1. Data Types: In the C# version, the balance is represented as a `decimal` type, which is a high-precision floating-point number. In the Java version, the balance is represented as a `double` type, which is a double-precision floating-point number. The `decimal` type in C# is more precise than the `double` type in Java, making it more suitable for financial calculations where precision is important.

2. Properties vs Getters: The C# version uses properties (`Id` and `Balance`) to encapsulate the account's data. The `get` accessor is used to read the value of the properties, and the `set` accessor is private, meaning it can only be modified within the `Account` class. On the other hand, the Java version uses a getter method (`getBalance()`) to read the value of the balance. Java does not support properties like C#, so getter and setter methods are used instead.

3. User Interaction: The main difference between the two versions is how they interact with the user. The C# version creates two accounts and performs operations on them without any user input. The Java version, however, uses a `Scanner` to take user input and perform operations based on that input. It provides a menu for the user to choose an operation (deposit, withdraw, transfer, check balance, or exit), and it continues to provide this menu in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

4. Account Identification: The C# version includes an `Id` property for each account, which is not present in the Java version. This could be useful for identifying accounts in a system with multiple accounts.

5. Error Handling: Both versions print an error message when a withdrawal or transfer is attempted with insufficient funds. However, the Java version also handles invalid menu choices by printing an "Invalid choice" message.
